## DVHACKS
Diablo Valley College is throwing its first ever hackathon! This is an event where you can hack together anything you can dream of. Hopefully you will learn new programming skills along the way, and present your finished product at the end of the event. There will be workshops, mentors, and other resources to help you build cool software!
